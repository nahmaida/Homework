The aura would probably be orange or yellow.
The dataset contains the 100 most streamed songs, which are typically energetic and, well, popular, leading to an orange or yellow aura.
However, this wouldn't accurately represent the listener's true aura.
Actual auras are calculated using the "moods" of songs, which are difficult to determine using just tempo, energy, and similar metrics.

Predicting the moods of songs and then determining a user's aura color would make for a pretty fun machine learning project.
